This tiny repo demonstrates how to organize supporting modules
and tests each in their own subdirectory ('code' and 'tests')
to be accessible for importation as needed.

driver.py can import modules from 'code' using
    from code import <module>
and testing code can import in the same way because
the project directory has been added to sys.path
(  sys.path.insert(0, os.path.split(sys.path[0])[0])  )
